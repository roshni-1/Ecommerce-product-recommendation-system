# E-commerce Product Recommendation System

## Introduction

This project is an implementation of an e-commerce product recommendation system. The recommendation system uses collaborative filtering to suggest products to users based on their historical interactions with the platform. Collaborative filtering is a popular approach for building recommendation systems and relies on the idea that users who have interacted with similar products in the past will be interested in similar products in the future.

## Features

- Collaborative filtering-based recommendation system.
- Provides top product recommendations for users.
- Supports multiple interaction types, such as viewing, purchasing, and rating.
- Utilizes Fastai, a deep learning library, for model training and prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Fastai library
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/roshni-1/ecommerce-recommendation-system.git


### Usage

Prepare your dataset:

Ensure that your dataset contains columns for user IDs, product IDs, interaction types, timestamps, and ratings (if available).
The dataset should be in a CSV format.
Train the recommendation model:

Load the dataset using Pandas.
Preprocess and clean the data as needed.
Train the collaborative filtering model using Fastai.
Get recommendations:

Use the trained model to get top product recommendations for specific users.
Customize the code to suit your application's requirements.
Visualize the results:

Utilize data visualization techniques to gain insights into user interactions, product popularity, and recommendation quality.
